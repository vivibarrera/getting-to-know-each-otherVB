		<h3>Introduction</h3>
		<p>Hi! My Name is Viviana but you can call me Vivi.I am a freshman at Lewis University majoring in Cybersecurity. I have a little sister who is five years younger than me and two dogs, One is husky golden retriver mix and the other a shitzu poodle. An odd duo but I love them. I have a bad habit of buying books I plan to read in the future which can be an expensive hobby. My birthday is October 5th which is why my favorite season is fall I like the cold but not snow so perfect birthday weather in my opinion. Anyway get to know a little bit more about me by scrolling through my web page.</p> Add me on Discord: veevee10#7669 <p></p> Email me at vivianabarrera@leiwsu.edu
		<h3>What would I like to learn from this course?</h3>
     I am excited to start learning the fundamentals of coding and what goes into creating things we find on the internet. I have always been very interested in computers so I hope I can learn the developmental side of them.
<h4>My Favorite Hobbies
    <p></p> I love reading mostly dystopian books and romance novels are great too, but nothing beats the Harry Pottter books. I did learn how to sew during quarantine but I have done it much since only to fix some clothing pieces. I take walks and occasionally go hiking at starved rock if the weather is nice.
</h4><h2>Fun Fact I work for a cyberinsurance firm :)
